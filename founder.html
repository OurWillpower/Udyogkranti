    <h1>Founder’s Note</h1>

    <p>
        UdyogKranti O2O is born out of long-term exposure to how real business
        actually happens on the ground — not how it is portrayed on platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over the years, I have worked with manufacturers, professionals,
        healthcare enterprises, technology firms, and MSMEs.
        Across industries, the same issues repeat:
        intermediaries dominate conversations, verification is superficial,
        and genuine decision-making is replaced by noise.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most B2B platforms optimise for listings and leads.
        UdyogKranti O2O is designed to optimise for outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mandatory verification, rejection of agents,
        and capability-first matching are not features —
        they are foundational principles.
    </p>

    <p>
        This platform is being built patiently and transparently,
        with the intent to serve serious businesses over the long term,
        not to chase short-term traction.
    </p>
