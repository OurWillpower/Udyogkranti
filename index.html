    <h1>Direct Business. Verified at Origin.</h1>
    <p>
        UdyogKranti O2O is a decision-first B2B platform that connects
        first-level manufacturers and direct service providers directly with buyers —
        without agents, brokers, or intermediaries.

    <h2>Why UdyogKranti Exists</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Because lead marketplaces optimise for volume, not outcomes.</li>
        <li>Because intermediaries thrive where verification is weak.</li>
        <li>Because serious businesses lose time, money, and trust.</li>
        <li>Because decisions deserve clarity, not noise.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Built from Real Business Experience</h2>
    <p>
        UdyogKranti O2O is founded by a business practitioner who has spent
        decades building companies, advising enterprises, and working closely
        with manufacturers, professionals, and MSMEs across sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
        This platform is not inspired by theory or venture trends.
        It is shaped by repeated exposure to failed deals, misrepresented capabilities,
        agent-driven distortions, and time wasted on unverified leads.
    </p>
    <p>
        The strict rules on UdyogKranti O2O are intentional.
        They exist to protect genuine businesses and enable confident decision-making.
